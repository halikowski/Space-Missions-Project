# Space-Missions-Project
Cleaning and analysis of a space missions dataset.
This dataset contains space mission data for years 1957-2020, including the 'Cold War' between USA and USSR. 
It is my first professional project, done solely by me, as a beiginning of Data Engineering and Data Science journey.
